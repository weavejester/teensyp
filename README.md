# TeensyP [![Build Status](https://github.com/weavejester/teensyp/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/weavejester/teensyp/actions/workflows/test.yml)

A small, zero-dependency Clojure TCP server that uses Java NIO.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your deps.edn file:

    dev.weavejester/teensyp {:mvn/version "0.1.1"}

Or to your Leiningen project file:

    [dev.weavejester/teensyp "0.1.1"]

## Usage

At minimum, TeensyP requires a port to listen on and a handler function:

```clojure
(require '[teensyp.server :as tcp])

(tcp/start-server {:port 3000, :handler demo-handler})```
```

The handler function has three arities, and defines how the server
behaves.

```clojure
(import 'java.nio.ByteBuffer)

(defn demo-handler
  ([write]
   ;; With 1 argument, we can write ByteBuffers via the write function.
   ;; The return value is the channel's state.
   {:read-bytes 0})
  ([state ^ByteBuffer buffer write]
   ;; With 3 arguments, we handle read data stored in a ByteBuffer. We
   ;; can update the channel's state by returning a new value, and write
   ;; to the output channel with the write function.
   (update state :read-bytes + (.remaining buffer)))
  ([state exception]
   ;; With 2 arguments, we have the channel closing. If it closed due to an
   ;; exception, that exception is passed as the second argument, otherwise it
   ;; will be nil.
  ))
```

The handler maintains a `state`, which can be any Clojure data
structure, but is usually a map. This state is unique to the channel,
and is updated each time the channel is read from by the 3-arity form of
the handler.

The handler is guaranteed to be called sequentially for the same
channel. That is, the 1-arity accept is always first, then 2-arity close
is always last, and each handler call must finish before the next
begins.

The `write` function accepts a single `ByteBuffer` argument, or one of
three special marker objects:

- `teensyp.server/CLOSE`        - closes the channel
- `teensyp.server/PAUSE-READS`  - pause reads until resumed
- `teensyp.server/RESUME-READS` - resume reads
